# CLAUDE.md — puzzcombinator

Orientation for a fresh session. Read this, skim `README.md` and
`examples/hunts/mock_hunt/hunt.py`, and you're caught up — you do **not** need any prior
chat transcript. Deeper rationale lives in the auto-loaded memory files
(`design-principles`, `roadmap`) and in `git log` (commit messages are detailed).

## What this is

A modular Python library for **authoring treasure-hunt games**. It is a
**design-time tool for the hunt's designer**: create puzzles, compose them into a
hunt graph, and generate printable materials. It does **not** play or grade a
hunt — there is no answer-checking anywhere (in a physical hunt, correctness is
implicit when one puzzle's output is the next one's input). Live
progress-tracking is a future, separate layer.

## ⚠️ Refactor in progress (bottom-up rebuild, started 2026-06-04)

We are rebuilding the library **one layer at a time, lowest first**, to keep each
change small. **Phase 1 — the Artifact layer — is done** (audience removed from
artifacts; minimal single-thing primitives; a new composite). See
`src/puzzcombinator/artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md` for the full artifact guide.

**The higher layers have NOT been migrated yet and currently do not run.**
`puzzles/*`, `serialization/codec.py`, `rendering/binder.py`, the top-level
`src/puzzcombinator/__init__.py` re-exports, and the tests for those layers still
reference the old `audience`-on-artifact design. Below, the **Artifact** model is
current; the **Puzzle / serialization-codec / binder** descriptions still describe
the *pre-refactor target* and are the next phases to migrate (puzzles next) — treat
them as "where we're heading," not "what runs today." Only `pytest tests/artifacts/`
is green right now.

## The core model (artifact-on-edge, rearchitected 2026-06-04)

A hunt is a **directed graph of actions**, and the graph is the **flow of
artifacts**:
- **`Edge`** carries `content: tuple[Artifact, ...]` — the artifacts flowing from
  one action to the next. There is no `Content` wrapper and no `text`/`data`/`puzzle`
  fields anymore.
- **`Artifact`** (in `rendering/fragment.py`) is the universal **thing that
  renders** carried on edges: a registry-backed, serializable renderable that knows
  nothing about audience. **Its primitives, composite, custom-type recipe, and
  serialization are documented in full in `src/puzzcombinator/artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md`
  — read that for the artifact layer; the bullet here only covers how artifacts ride
  the graph.**
- **`Puzzle`** (in `puzzles/base.py`) is an authoring-time **generator**, *not*
  stored on edges and *not* serialized. `puzzle.artifacts(name=None, *, audience=
  Audience.PLAYER)` returns a `{name: Artifact}` map (or one artifact by name). It
  emits a player set and a game-master set; the designer places those artifacts on
  edges. A multi-piece puzzle (riddle lines, R4 grid+grille) is just a generator
  that emits several artifacts — placeable together or **scattered** across edges
  and assembled at a merge.
- **`Node`** is a **pure action** with a free-form **`action`** string
  (`"solve"`/`"find"`/`"move"`/…). **No `payload`, no `kind` enum.** Start/end are
  derived from topology (no incoming / no outgoing edges). The model is
  **stateless** — no player state, ever.
- **Ids are internal, not author-supplied.** `GraphBuilder.node(...)` returns a
  **handle** (the node id) you pass to `connect` — no fluent `.node().node()`
  chaining (connect still returns self). Omitted node ids auto-generate (`n1`, `n2`,
  …). Artifact ids default to `{type_name}-{uuid}`; a puzzle prefixes its emitted
  artifacts as `{puzzle.id}-{name}` so pass an explicit puzzle/artifact id only for
  readable `players/` filenames. `Graph.assemble` rejects duplicate **player**
  artifact ids (those name output files; GM artifacts are exempt).

Authoring: `connect(source, target, *artifacts)`. Example —
`connect(start, solve, *cipher.artifacts().values(), *cipher.artifacts(audience=GM).values())`,
then `connect(solve, find, TextArtifact("go to the kitchen"))`. The artifacts ride
the edges *into* the action that consumes them; a puzzle's answer is a separate
artifact you place on the outgoing edge.

## Package map (`src/puzzcombinator/`)

- **`core/`** — `graph.py` (Node, Edge, Graph), `builder.py` (`GraphBuilder`),
  `ordering.py` (`chronological_order` topo sort w/ branch+merge gating,
  `required_inputs`, `produced_outputs` — both return `list[Artifact]`). Stdlib
  only; artifact-agnostic (references only the `Artifact` ABC, for typing).
- **`artifacts/`** — the **orphan** artifacts (`text.py`, `image.py`, `svg.py`), the
  composite (`composite.py`), the registry (`registry.py`), and `export.py` (the
  per-primitive native file writers + a re-export of the agnostic ones). Depends only
  on `rendering` + `errors`, so `puzzles/` builds on top of it without a cycle. **Fully
  documented in `artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md`** — go there for the types, the custom-type
  recipe, and serialization.
- **`puzzles/`** — `base.py` (`Puzzle` generator ABC) and the puzzle types, each
  pairing a `Puzzle` generator with its `Artifact` subclass(es): `cipher.py`,
  `crossword.py`, `r4.py`, `riddle.py`. Depends on `artifacts` + `rendering` +
  `errors`. (An artifact with no puzzle logic — text, image, a future lat/long — is
  an *orphan* and lives in `artifacts/`, not here.)
- **`serialization/`** — `codec.py` (Graph ↔ dict; the only place that knows the
  on-disk shape; each edge's content is a list of artifacts round-tripped via the
  registry as `{type,id,name,audience,payload}`), `__init__.py` (`to_json`/`from_json`
  stdlib, `to_yaml`/`from_yaml` lazy optional), `schema.py` (`SCHEMA_VERSION = "2"`).
  The interchange seam for a future GUI/monitoring layer. Keystone invariant:
  `from_json(to_json(g)) == g`.
- **`rendering/`** — `fragment.py` (`RenderFragment` {markup, kind html|svg,
  styles}, `Audience`, and the `Artifact` ABC), `presets.py` (fragment factories),
  `export.py` (agnostic single-artifact file writers: `html_document` + `write_html`),
  `binder.py` (the whole-hunt output layer — **STALE, not yet migrated**).
  Artifact-agnostic. **Documented in `rendering/RENDERING.md`.**

## Output / the binder

`rendering/binder.py` turns a graph into a **bundle**:
- `game_master_binder(graph) -> str` — one HTML doc: a page per node (topological
  order) rendering **all** artifacts on its **incoming and outgoing** edges (both
  `PLAYER` and `GAME_MASTER` ones, so the answer key shows the player pieces *and*
  the revealed answers) + a production checklist.
- `player_pages(graph) -> dict[path,str]` — one printable per **`PLAYER`** artifact,
  keyed `players/<artifact.id>.{html,svg}`. `GAME_MASTER` artifacts render only in
  the binder and produce no file.
- `hunt_bundle(graph) -> dict[path,str]` (pure) and `write_bundle(bundle, dir)`
  (the only filesystem I/O).
The binder holds **no artifact-specific CSS** — each `RenderFragment` carries its
own `styles`, which the binder aggregates. So a new artifact needs zero binder edits.

## Key design rules (don't violate without discussing)

- **Authoring-only** — no `Validator`/`check`/`is_solved`/answer-gating anywhere.
- **Loose I/O coupling** — a puzzle's solution is NOT auto-linked to the outgoing
  edge; the designer hand-writes the answer artifact. (Revisit only when drift
  causes real bugs.)
- **Artifact-agnostic core + serialization + binder** — they never name a concrete
  artifact type; everything goes through the `Artifact` ABC and the registry.
- **Pure-stdlib core, no pydantic** — dataclasses; format knowledge only in
  `serialization/`; heavy deps (if ever) only inside the artifact that needs them.
- **String ids, no object cycles** — edges reference nodes by id; node wiring is
  recomputed on load (gives clean value-equality for round-trip tests). Ids are
  auto-generated, not author-invented (see the core-model note above). Artifact
  `__eq__`/`__hash__` is **value-based** (type + id + name + payload), which is what
  makes the round-trip `==` invariant hold. Puzzle generators are not serialized and
  are not compared.
- **GUI = producer, binder = consumer, model+serialization = the seam.** A visual
  hunt map is deferred (GUI-adjacent).

## Adding a type (the whole recipe)

1. **The artifact** (the serializable renderable). The full recipe — `type_name`,
   `@register_artifact`, `to_payload`/`from_payload`, a pure `render()`, and where it
   lives — is in `artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md` ("Writing a custom artifact"). A pure clue
   can reuse `TextArtifact`; several things together is a `CompositeArtifact`.
2. **The puzzle generator** (*only* if a single authoring object emits several
   artifacts or needs answer-vs-blank logic). Subclass `Puzzle`, set `type_name`
   (the id prefix), implement `_artifacts(audience) -> list[Artifact]` building the
   per-audience instances (ids via `self.artifact_id(name)`); the base
   `artifacts(name=None, *, audience=...)` does the map/name dispatch. Put the
   audience decision (what's blank vs revealed) *here*, baked into each instance's
   payload. **Skip this step for an orphan artifact** — one with nothing to generate
   (text, image, a lat/long). It has no puzzle; the designer constructs it directly,
   building each single-audience instance by hand (see `ImageArtifact`'s player vs
   game-master use in the mock hunt). Convenience constructors (`from_file`, …) go on
   the artifact as classmethods.

Where it lives: an **orphan** artifact goes in `artifacts/` (beside `text.py` /
`image.py`); a **puzzle-bound** artifact goes in `puzzles/` in the same file as its
generator. Export the new classes from that package's `__init__.py` and the package
`__init__.py`. **No edits to `core/`, `serialization/`, or `rendering/`.** Add a test
file mirroring the others (payload round-trip + render; for a generator, the
`artifacts()` map + audience behavior).

## Commands / the "done" bar

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# Mid-refactor: the artifact + rendering layers are green; puzzles/binder are not.
# A full `pytest`/`mypy` fails by design until the higher layers are migrated.
pytest tests/artifacts/ tests/rendering/   # green (tests/rendering/test_binder.py is skipped, pending migration)
ruff check src/puzzcombinator/artifacts src/puzzcombinator/rendering/fragment.py \
  src/puzzcombinator/rendering/export.py src/puzzcombinator/rendering/presets.py
mypy src/puzzcombinator/artifacts src/puzzcombinator/rendering/fragment.py \
  src/puzzcombinator/rendering/export.py
```
The full bar (restore once each layer is migrated): `pytest --cov=puzzcombinator`
(100% on `core/`), `ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy src/puzzcombinator`
all clean, and `python examples/hunts/mock_hunt/hunt.py` regenerating its `out/`.
Conventions: `src/` layout, hatchling, `requires-python >=3.12` (PEP 695 generics
used), free-form `action` strings, commit messages end with the Co-Authored-By
trailer. Generated `examples/*_out/` and `*.html`/`*.svg` are gitignored.

## Current status & likely next steps

**Mid bottom-up refactor (see the banner at the top).** Phase 1 (the Artifact layer)
is done and green: audience-free `Artifact` ABC, the `text`/`image`/`svg` primitives,
the `CompositeArtifact`, the registry envelope helpers, and the single-artifact file
writers (`rendering/export.py` + `artifacts/export.py`) — documented in
`artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md` and `rendering/RENDERING.md`, covered by `tests/artifacts/`
and `tests/rendering/` (the binder/puzzle integration tests are quarantined in
`tests/rendering/test_binder.py`, skipped with a reason until their layers migrate).

**Next phase: puzzles.** `puzzles/*` import but **fail at runtime** — they still build
artifacts with `audience=` (e.g. `_artifacts(audience)`), a kwarg the audience-free
`Artifact` no longer accepts. Migrate them to the new model; the key design decision is
**where the player-vs-answer-key split lives now that artifacts are audience-free**
(today a puzzle emits both a player and a GM instance; the new home is likely a
designer choice at placement, or two explicitly-named emitted artifacts). After that:
`serialization/codec.py` (drop `audience` from the edge envelope; reuse
`artifact_to_dict`/`artifact_from_dict`), then `rendering/binder.py` (re-derive
player/GM routing without an artifact `audience` field — its own open design question),
then the top-level `__init__` re-exports, examples, and the remaining tests. Once
everything is migrated, `examples/hunts/mock_hunt/hunt.py` is the end-to-end reference
to get green again.

Beyond the refactor (defer unless asked): more puzzle types; the visual hunt-map
view (V1) / `action`-filtered subgraph binder views; GUI authoring layer; the
tracking/monitoring layer (layer 4 — the only place answer-checking would ever
live). Deferred GUI-readiness: optional node x/y positions + per-puzzle parameter
metadata in the serialized format.
